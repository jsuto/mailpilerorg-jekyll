<p><strong>Important!</strong></p>

<p>Please keep in mind that the purpose of the issue tracker is to report bugs, and suggest new features. A “how to do this or that” problem is probably more eligible to the mailing list, than to the issue tracker, so don't open an issue if there's actually no bug.</p>

<p>Please always include the following info in the issue description:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Operating system, Linux distribution</li>
  <li>piler version, and build number (see piler -V output)</li>
  <li>possible error messages, relevant log entries</li>
  <li>relevant info what happened with the archive</li>
  <li>anything else relevant to understand the issue</li>
</ul>


<p>If you think that some sensitive data is required to understand the situation, then don't copy it to the issue, rather send it to my address (again, see piler -V output).</p>

<p>Proceed to the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/jsuto/piler/issues?status=new&status=open" target="_blank">issue tracker</a></p>
