Piler supports and runs in docker just fine. Please see the docker/ directory how to build the image for yourself (or you may use sutoj/piler:1.4.4 image), and some examples at [https://github.com/jsuto/piler-examples/tree/master/examples/docker](https://github.com/jsuto/piler-examples/tree/master/examples/docker)

Docker allows piler to run in environments like zentyal or nethserver.
