The <a href="https://mailpiler.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> found at the mailpiler.com site applies to this site as well. There are some specialities applying to this site only, see below for more.

## Mailing lists

There are some piler mailing lists to provide a convenient platform to discuss various topics related to the piler software, get help using the software, etc. You are required to perform a double opt-in procedure to subscribe to either of these mailing lists. The subscription is voluntarily.

When you send an email to the mailing list your email is sent to the members of the mailing list as well as to The Mail Archive service. This latter service provides a searchable archive for the mailing list, and you may find their privacy policy at [https://www.mail-archive.com/faq.html#privacy](https://www.mail-archive.com/faq.html#privacy). If you don't want your email sent to the piler mailing list appear on the mail archive site or don't want it to be distributed to other mailing list members, then please don't send an email to any of the piler mailing lists.

Also you may unsubscribe from the mailing list at any time by sending an email to piler-user+unsubscribe@list.acts.hu. You may also send an email to privacy(AT)mailpiler(DOT)com address with your request to manually unsubscribe you from the mailing list. This may take up to 5 business days to perform.

## BitBucket

We also use the BitBucket service to provide artifacts you can download, and an [issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/jsuto/piler/issues) where you may report problems, issues with the software, you can suggest new features, etc. The use of BitBucket is also voluntarily.

Note that whatever information you share on BitBucket is publicly accessible, so you should be extremely careful, and only share what is absolutely required for resolving your issue. There are some cases when you are required to provide some sensitive information, eg. email headers, etc. In such cases you are encouraged to obfuscate any sensitive data, eg. names, email addresses, etc. It's also possible to share such information via a different channel which should be discussed on a per case basis.

If you accidentally release any sensitive information to BitBucket, then notify the piler team at privacy(AT)mailpiler(DOT)com address, and we'll do our best to assist you removing it. In certain cases beyond our capabilities on BitBucket (since we are mere users only without administrator privileges) you may have to contact BitBucket support directly and ask for their help resolving the issue. You may find BitBucket's privacy policy at [https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy).
